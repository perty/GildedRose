<h1>Gilded Rose</h1>
<p>
Hi and welcome to team Gilded Rose. As you know, we are a small inn with a prime location in a prominent city ran by a
friendly innkeeper named Allison. We also buy and sell only the finest goods. Unfortunately, our goods are constantly
degrading in quality as they approach their sell by date. We have a system in place that updates our inventory for us.
It was developed by a no-nonsense type named Leeroy, who has moved on to new adventures. Your task is to add the new
feature to our system so that we can begin selling a new category of items. First an introduction to our system:
</p>
<ul>
    <li> All items have a SellIn value which denotes the number of days we have to sell the item</li>
    <li> All items have a Quality value which denotes how valuable the item is</li>
    <li> At the end of each day our system lowers both values for every item</li>
</ul>

<p>Pretty simple, right? Well this is where it gets interesting:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a concordion:run="concordion" href="QualityDegrades.html">Once the sell by date has passed, Quality degrades
        twice as fast</a></li>
    <li><a concordion:run="concordion" href="QualityNeverNegative.html">
        The Quality of an item is never negative</a></li>
    <li> "Aged Brie" actually increases in Quality the older it gets</li>
    <li> The Quality of an item is never more than 50</li>
    <li> "Sulfuras", being a legendary item, never has to be sold or decreases in Quality</li>
    <li> "Backstage passes", like aged brie, increases in Quality as it's SellIn value approaches; Quality increases by
        2 when there are 10 days or less and by 3 when there are 5 days or less but Quality drops to 0 after the concert
    </li>
</ul>

<p>We have recently signed a supplier of conjured items. This requires an update to our system:</p>

<p>
    "Conjured" items degrade in Quality twice as fast as normal items.
</p>

<p>
Feel free to make any changes to the `updateQuality` method and add any new code as long as everything still works
correctly. However, do not alter the `se.crisp.edu.refactor.gildedrose.Item` class or Items property as those belong to
the goblin in the corner who will insta-rage and one-shot you as he doesn't believe in shared code ownership.
</p>
<p>
Just for clarification, an item can never have its Quality increase above 50, however "Sulfuras" is a legendary item and
as such its Quality is 80 and it never alters.
